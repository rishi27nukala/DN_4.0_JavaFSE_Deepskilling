# Understanding Recursive Algorithms

**Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It continues to call itself until it reaches a base case, which stops the recursion.
- Recursion helps break down complex problems into simpler subproblems that follow the same pattern. 
- It often results in shorter, cleaner, and easier-to-understand code, especially for problems with repetitive or nested structure.
## Components of Recursion

1. **Base Case** – the stopping condition.
2. **Recursive Case** – the part where the function calls itself with a reduced problem.

- **Simplifies complex problems** like:
  - Divide and Conquer - Problems like merge sort or quicksort split into smaller subproblems.
  - Tree traversal - Recursive calls simplify visiting children or neighbors.
  - Backtracking - Such as Sudoku, maze solving, or generating permutations.
  - Mathematical formulas - Problems like factorial, Fibonacci have a natural recursive definition.
- **Reduces code size** for repeated logic.
- **Natural fit** for divide-and-conquer algorithms.
