## Search Algorithms 

- **Linear Search**: Sequentially checks each product.
- **Binary Search**: Sorts the array and performs logarithmic-time search.


## Time Complexity

| Method          | Time Complexity | Use Case                       |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Linear Search   | O(n)             | Small or unsorted datasets     |
| Binary Search   | O(log n)         | Large and sorted datasets     |


- **Binary Search** is faster for large datasets but requires pre-sorting.
- **Linear Search** is flexible and works on any dataset without sorting but it is inefficient for large datasets.

Binary Search is better suited for a high-performance e-commerce platform where speed, scalability, and responsiveness matter.
However, Linear Search is useful in quick, small-scale, or unsorted scenarios.
